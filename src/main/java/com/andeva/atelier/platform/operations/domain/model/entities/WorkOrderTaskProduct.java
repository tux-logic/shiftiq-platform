/**
 * Entity representing a product associated with a work order task. This entity is part of the Work Order Task aggregate and contains details about the product, such as its ID, quantity, unit price, and total amount. It also includes auditing fields for tracking creation and modification times, as well as soft deletion handling.
 * The @SQLDelete annotation is used to implement soft deletion by updating the deleted_at timestamp instead of physically removing the record from the database. The @SQLRestriction annotation ensures that only records that have not been marked as deleted (i.e., where deleted_at is null) are returned in queries.
