 * Entity representing a Work Order Task in the automotive repair shop management system. This class is an aggregate root that encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a task within a work order, including its associated products, status transitions, and audit information. It uses JPA annotations for persistence and includes logic to manage task details and enforce business rules related to task modifications based on its status.
