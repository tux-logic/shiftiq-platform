/**
 * Aggregate root representing a Work Order in the automotive service center context. This class encapsulates all the business logic related to managing a Work Order, including adding/removing tasks and products, updating details, and handling state transitions. It also integrates with Spring Data's domain events to publish relevant events when certain actions are performed, such as reserving products or marking the order as paid.
 * The WorkOrder entity is designed to be persisted in a relational database using JPA, with appropriate annotations for entity mapping, auditing, and soft deletion. It maintains a list of associated WorkOrderTask entities, which represent the individual tasks that need to be performed as part of the work order.
